    <h2>Angular Routing</h2>
    <p>
        Angular is designed to build single-page applications (SPAs) while also handling routing by showing or hiding portions of the display that correspond to particular components.
        <br>
        <br>
        To handle routing in Angular, you can use the <a class="text-link" href="https://angular.io/api/router/Router">Router</a> along with a few other features, but for simple routing, the <a class="text-link" href="https://angular.io/api/router/Router">Router</a> is sufficient.
    </p>
    <h3>Basic Routing</h3>
    <p>
        Basic routing can be handled with simple routes.
        <br>
        First in <em class="text-file">app-routing.module.ts</em> define your routes like so
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-ts">let routes: Routes = [
    &#123; path: 'home', component: HomeComponent &#125;,
    &#123; path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full'&#125;,
];</code></pre>
    <p>Basic routes pattern is <em class="text-file">&#123; <strong>path:</strong> "URL path", <strong>component</strong>: "Component that should be displayed" &#125;</em></p>
    <p>Then you can choose one of few attempts to navigate to another URL. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The simplest one is just adding
            <pre><code>&lt;a [routerLink]="['/home']"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Another way of routing is via button click (this is approach that I took creating this site)
            <pre><code>&lt;button (click)="navigateToHome()"&gt;</code></pre>
            Then in your component function navigateToHome() need to be implemented.
            First Router is needed, so inject it in constructor, then implement method with help of router.
            <pre><code class="language-ts codeblock">constructor(private router: Router) &#123;&#125;

navigateToHome() &#123;
    this.router.navigate(['/home']);
&#125;</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>Dynamic Routing</h3>
    <p>Dynamic Routing is very useful when it comes to routing to specific <em>id/tag/user/item.</em> You can define a base route and then display context based of on url.</p>
    <h3>Child Routes</h3>
    <p>Next step in routing is adding child routes. Child routing helps with organize paths and gives them hierarchy so user can see the actual path of view.</p>
